**Short Summary - 'Brains May Predict the Future'** 
<br><br>
Mental representations or perception-models are concepts central to early cognitive sciences and related disciplines. Learning theories and studies of Monotropy and attachment accentuate the role of cognitive models in various perceptive functions and learning. Though this concept is upheld by a multitude of studies, few elucidate  the mechanisms by which this Bayesian phenomenon occurs. Predictive Coding, for example, neglects a linear model and implies a process that mimics a negative feedback loop. Nonetheless, such a model requires further investigation as still the internal mechanisms of the phenomenon are unclear.
