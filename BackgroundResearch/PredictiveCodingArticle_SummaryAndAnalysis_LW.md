**‘To Make Sense of the Present, Brains May Predict the Future’ - Jordana Cepelewicz, July 2018**

This article proposes the ‘predictive coding’ theory as an explanation for how the brain perceives it’s surroundings, contradicting the original notion that the brain works by processing sensory input. Cepelewicz instead suggests that the brain is ‘pre-programmed’ with expectations and predictions which it has created from previous experiences. The idea is that it then adjusts it's preconceptions as a result of the differences between the predictions and reality, improving accuracy and constantly refining the brain's perception of the sensory experience.

This refinement occurs as the brain works to explain away any differences, or prediction errors, it experiences by creating logical explanations for the changes. However any alterations it is unable to account for are thought to be passed up into higher levels of the brain for further cognitive processing and resulting adjustment of the brain’s ‘beliefs'. 

Experiments which provide evidence for the legitimacy of the theory include those which measure the brain’s electrophysical response to unexpected situations (such as coming across a nonsensical word in a sentence). In this situation it displays the ‘N400 effect’ where the brain experiences a lag in processing due to the mismatch between expectation and reality. However the idea that the entire brain works by constantly constructing hypothesis to fill in missing data in a sort of ‘controlled hallucination’ is not universally agreed on. Many still believe that the process is confined to certain networks and not used universally by systems in the brain with a disagreement between what is viewed as ‘predictive coding’ and ‘predictive processing’ creating discrepancy between scientists. 

Whether or not it accounts for all aspects of brain processing, the article puts predictive coding forward as a potential mechanism for improving artificial intelligence algorithms inferring that this application of the theory is widely agreed on by the majority of those working in neuroscience and could have major implications for the progression of this technology.

**Further questions brought up by the article:**

1. What are the main differences between predictive coding and predictive processing? Is the article suggesting that purely predictive coding or a combination of the two is responsible for neurological functioning?
2. Does predictive coding have real world applications? For example, how successful have scientists been in implementing the theory into artificial intelligence?
3. Aside from a disagreement about predictive processing and coding, what other reasons do scientists have for being skeptical about the theory? (Counter arguments?)
