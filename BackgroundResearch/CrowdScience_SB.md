## Crowd Science 

This article begins by discussing the new movement of Crowd Science, which is a more unconventional approach to conducting scientific studies. It involves the collaboration and contributions of a large number of people, globally.  The article describes three such projects - Galaxy Zoo, Foldit and Polymath, and their successes in recruiting many people and achieving their desired goal. It also mentions several other examples of established crowd science projects, and a brief description of what they ask the participants to do. The article then discusses the features that distinguish this method of conducting science from other methods such as traditional ‘Mertonian’ science or other initiatives such as innovation contests. As well as the differences between crowd science and other methods of science, there is also diversity between different projects within the method of crowd science. Some projects require more complex and specialised skills, such as Polymath, whereas others require more basic, general skills, such as Galaxy Zoo. The article continues to discuss the benefits of such projects and also the potential difficulties and disadvantages.
