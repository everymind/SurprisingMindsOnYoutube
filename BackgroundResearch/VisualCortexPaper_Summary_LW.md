The article discusses how visual information is processed and integrated by the brain, exploring the role of the visual cortex in not only interpreting signals received from photoreceptors in the eye but also in other processes such as learning. It suggests that visual perception is a result not only of feedforward signals from the current visual experience but a combination of both expectation and visual signals received from the retina bringing up the notion of predictive coding theory once again. 

This time the theory is supported by the behaviour of mice who have had their field of vision disconnected from their locomotion in a VR setting where the situation created causes the visual input to deviate from the mouse’s usual optic flow. This is hypothesised to create prediction errors which create a ‘mismatch’ response which is observed as increased pyramidal neuronal firing (this was thought to be caused by the inhibition of somatostatin (SOM) expressing interneurons due to cholinergic input from the basal forebrain as the mouse moves around). However since this situation reversed as soon as ordinary optic flow was restored this indicates that there is a strong interplay between visuomotor expectation and sensory input from the eye (feedforward signals). 


Questions:
- What does the author mean when she refers to the error signals only occurring with normal visuomotor experience?
- Could there be any other explanations, other than prediction error signals, which explain the mice’s behaviour when their optic flow is confused?
- Has there been any studies done on humans in a similar context which back up this theory and if so what is the relevance to our studies of the human visual experience?
