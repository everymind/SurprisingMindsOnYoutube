**Short Summary - Carina Curto**
<br><br>
Understanding neural connections and their mechanism of action is an essential aspect of neuroscience - yet these neuronal interactions, being highly intricate structures are difficult to study and interpret. Such interactions can be understood by considering much different perspectives such as algebraic topology - which employs mathematical tools to interpret the connectome. Cartina Curto suggests this as an alternative starter to understanding the web of cells that comprise the nervous system - a more mathematical and hence simplistic model of the connectome.

This article should elaborate more on how exactly algebraic topology is used to decipher the connectome.
