**‘The Key to Modelling Brains: Ignoring the Right Details’ - Siobhan Roberts, July 2018**

Roberts’ article stresses the value of approaching problems in neuroscience in a less conventional way explaining how her background in particle physics has proved vital to her research as a biologist despite her approach opposing traditional methods. She discusses how mathematical modelling has helped her to progress her studies in ‘connectomics’, the study of connections in the brain, by allowing her to easily recognise patterns in neuronal firing. 

Roberts also suggests that the ability to simplify models to only include essential components, disregarding details which have little or no relevance to the problem, is the most effective way to create hypotheses. These ‘beautiful models’, as she refers to them as, share fundamental characteristics: they are simple to describe, can be mathematically analysed and contain important ‘truths’ whilst they are not necessary completely accurate. These features allow them to be easily tested in an experimental context, synchronises research and makes the models easier to build upon in the future. 

For example, in her own models Roberts has used methods including assigning musical notes to neurons and determining amplitude based on the neuronal firing rate which she believes allows her to pick up recurring patterns by ear far more easily than if she were to try and analyse visual data patterns. Through the production of the models she believes that theorems can be generated and proved more easily. This in turn helps to provide an insight into how the model works in real life and how this may translate to the actual functioning of systems within brain 

**Further questions brought up by the article:**

1. Are their any other examples of successful ‘beautiful models’ (ie unrelated to musical note model)
2. If the models are not completely accurate, how can we be sure that the data will still be relevant/ patterns observed will still be present when examined in the context of the system as a whole?
3. Is there a risk of over-simplifying the models to the point at which they do not accurately represent the theory you are investigating?
