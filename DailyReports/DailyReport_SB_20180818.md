Brief description of the day: After spending the morning running final tests and making a few adjustments to the set-up, we set out to Regent's Park for our first day of field testing. The weather was overcast but no rain, which meant there were many people in the park. We set up on a bench along one of the main paths through the park, then Dara, Lauren and I tried to recruit participants. We found 2 ladies who were willing to try our experiment. Two other gentlemen stopped to talk with us, and seemed curious about it, but did not try out the experiment.

Highlights from conversations with participants and/or folks who stopped to chat: Both groups of people were curious about the use of eye tracking data, and its application in fields such as marketing. The two gentlemen initially thought we were carrying this out for a company, but they later realised that it was scientific research.
