Brief description of the day: many people come to reagent's park for the zoo. A lot of them were family.
When our first participants walked by us, DB said something like "hi, wanna try". It turned out they are interested in our experiment and we got them to participate.

Today was a sunny day so we had to hold the umbrella closely to the participants
*Question: instead of getting them describe what they saw in the view by themselves, whether getting them options to click would be a good idea
Advantages: remind them of what they watch, easier for us to recognize their description, 
Disadvantages: less freedom for participants to say anything

* We might want to have one person, keeping putting on the glasses when no participant is taking part (in order to attract passengers' attention)
might not be effective if we dont say anything properly to the passenger to get them know this is something they can participate
