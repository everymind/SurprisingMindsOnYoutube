**Brief description of the day:** 
<br>
Today was a relatively slow day - more so at the beginning (meaning more participants were recuited in the afternoon). It was difficult to engage with tourists at times due to language barriers, yet in the end we did succeed in gathering a somewhat more diverse group of people (of the 9 participants, 2 were children).

As expected, a few older participants mentioned that they too observed their younger relatives browse Youtube for the videos we used as stimuli. Some also seeemed quite interested in our unique approach to scientific research.
