Brief description of the day: We spent the morning understanding how to use the new features enabled during the experiment run, and then testing it out amongst ourselves. We set out to Regent's Park, and the weather was mainly cloudy. We also set up our experiment in fairly the same location as Saturday. The number of people in the park overall was relatively low at the start, but gradually started to increase as the day went along. We found quite a few people enthusiastic and interested in our experiment, and had quite a varied range of participants, however, we did not have any children who took part.

Highlights from conversations with participants and/or folks who stopped to chat: Similar to Saturday, a lot of the participants were intrigued by the uasage and application of our data by companies in marketing and advertising. One of the ladies had watched an interesting documentary about scientists from different fields working in other scientific fields which they hadn;t experienced before. This was great as it started a conversation about the 'segregation' of different fields within science, and how science must be brought out of the lab and into 'the wild', for everyone to get involved in, other scientists as well as the general public.
