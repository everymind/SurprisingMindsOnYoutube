Brief description of the day: We just did an hour or so of collection in the afternoon due to a rainy morning. The park was fairly quiet and we had a fair number of rejections however we managed to find some willing participants to do the study with.

Highlights from conversations with participants and/or folks who stopped to chat: We had a very interesting conversation with an old lady who thought that we should abstain completley from technology since it was ruining communication as well as a family who seemed really interested in the study and bringing science 'into the field'
