Brief description of the day: Today was the first field test of the environmental setup! We spent the morning making final de bugs and adjustments. I finalized the consent forms and participant info sheets for participants younger than 16, with hello mucha from a draft by Lauren, by having Sarayu, our resident under 16, proof read them. They are now sent to the ethics committee. The adult forms and info sheets I printed, in addition to follow up surveys, for use today. We walked to Regent's Park and picked a bench along the main path through the park. We settled in to test the setup on ourselves in the new environment, then I sent the interns off to find participants! They came back with two ladies who were lovely to chat with and enthusiastic about the study, perfect for our first subjects. 2 others also approached us to watch the experiment but didn't stay to participate.   
Highlights from conversations with participants and/or folks who stopped to chat: I only chatted with out participants. one does marketing and she me told about a pop science book by a neuroscientist that she's reading, which got me to talk about the challenges of science communication and the responsibilities of scientists to communicate well. I ando spoke with the other participant about how much or move eyes without us really noticing, and that what might mean in terms of the underlying biology.
