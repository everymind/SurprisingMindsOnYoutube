Brief description of the day: We just headed out in the afternoo after doing admin in the morning. Unfortunately the traffic was very light in the park (probably due to people off on bank holiday travels) and the weather quickly taking a turn for the worse. We were not too concerned about how much data we managed to collect as we anticipate a large number of participants at the festival this weekend so decided to call it a day early.

Highlights from conversations with participants and/or folks who stopped to chat: We had a lovely conversation about Danbee's research with our only participant and her friend who was a PhD maths student who both seemed genuinely interested in the project.
