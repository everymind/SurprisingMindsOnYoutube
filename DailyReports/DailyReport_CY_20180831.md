We had a presentation on August 31st.

Here are some notes I took.

It would have been great if we had set up a live-stream system. 
When we collected data, definitely more than two participants asked us whether the presentation would be livestreamed.
Although we recorded the presentation (the video file is in Adam's SD card), 
doing livestream and let other people know beforehand that we are doing livestream for the presentation shall help increase our views

When we hold this kind of event next time, I think we need a microphone, because some speakers' voice can be small.
Even the on-site audience can hear them clearly, this might be a concern for the audience on the internet.
Is there anyway to livestream the presentation not via computer's camera (not very easy to handle), perhaps connecting a camera to the computer
