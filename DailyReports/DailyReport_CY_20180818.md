Brief description of the day:  
we first ran demo at the SWC to adjust the setup. For some reasons, the pupil detection did not go well on Dara with her glasses
on (so she had to put on the setup first before putting on her glasses), but I did not encounter this problem. 

We went to regent's park for the 1st field test
It was cloudy at 1pm-2pm

*We had two volunteers partipating the experiments, two passengers walked by and chatted with us.

*We might want to have one person in charge of handing the consent form and information sheet to the volunteers 
while Danbee (or other people in the future) explain to them what the experiment is.

*During the experiment, instead of having multiple people surroudning the experiment participant, we might just need one person,
who in charge of setting up everything for the participant, because I was worried if the participant feel uncomfortable being surrounded by people

*We can split some people to talk to passenger who chatted with us and get them to participate the experiment or recruiting new
volunteers while one person is doing the experiment.

*in the future, we might need more than 1 setup so that we can run more experiments at the same time

Highlights from conversations with participants and/or folks who stopped to chat:

the passengers were curious whether we were supported by any company (for marketing), then they realized we are doing basic research.
They joked around having a person wearing this in front of his/her partner, 
so that the partner would know whether that person is looking at other person or not
