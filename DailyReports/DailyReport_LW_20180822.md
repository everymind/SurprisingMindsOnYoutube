Brief description of the day: 2 x 1-1.5hr sessions with participants split equally across these sessions. Used the 'traditional' format of recruiting particpants from passers-by who looked like they may be willing to participate which seemed to be effective with a mixture of polite refusals and agreements (often on the condition that it would only take five minutes though!). Many commented that the consent process was fairly time consuming which we were apologetic about but explained the neccessity.

Highlights from conversations with participants and/or folks who stopped to chat: Chatted to an american couple who were a paedeatrician and dentist who seemed interested in the process of data collection, our experiment and the work being done at the SWC. They chatted to us about their previous trip to the Wellcome collection and seemed interested in finding out the results of the project/seeing the final report.
