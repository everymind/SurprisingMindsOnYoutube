**Brief description of the day:** <br>Approached quite a few people yet only managed to recruit 9, one of which refused to have their recording saved (and only 8 follow-up surveys). It also seemed people had a preference for the term 'science' as opposed to 'neuroscience' - perhaps because the term sounds relatively new (something to keep in mind for the future). The day was very slow as the area was, at times, sparse, though, some passing by seemed interested once the group was already engaged.

**Highlights from conversations with participants and/or folks who stopped to chat:** <br> Most people seemed to be on a similar wavelength - participants were, like us, keen to understand why these videos were to so compelling to such large populations of people. We found ourselves deep in conversation with 3 participants sharing ideas about Youtubers and how perspectives have changed about these new internet-based professions.
