Brief description of the day: This was our first full day collecting data in Regent's Park and the weather was quite sunny, with little cloud. There were quite a few people in the park, but especially in the morning, they all seemed to be headed off to other places, like the zoo. Despite this, our first participant was a young child, and we had another child participant later on in the day. We also used similar recruiting techniques, but opened by briefly introducing ourselves first.

Highlights from conversations with participants and/or folks who stopped to chat: Most people were intrigued by this idea and keen to understand why these videos were so popular. We also had a conversation with some of the participants about the extensive usage of technology in many parts of our lives nowadays, and how it affects our brains as well as our overall behaviour.
