Brief description of the day:
The tablet was in low-battery so we started the experiments 40-min later than planned. Today is another cloudy day. 
At 15:00, it seems there is less crowded than Monday afternoon. Fortunately, we had two groups of young students
, who were very cooperative (probably because we look like as simliar age as them), nevertheless it seems both of them have less experience in science talks 
A student decided to do the experiments after the rest of her friends agreed to do the experiments with us.
Without Danbee, I feel we did not have any further conversation with the participants especially some science/technology topics
*SB was as reliable as the other day we did the experiment together.
Highlights from conversations with participants and/or folks who stopped to chat:
"I love watching kinder eggs" from one of the students
"I have seen you doing the experiment earlier before" from one of the participants
