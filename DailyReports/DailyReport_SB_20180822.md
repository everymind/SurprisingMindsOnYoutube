Brief description of the day: We started the day with just two of us running the study, yet we seemed to get a fair amount of participants in the morning. Although there were overall less people in the park today, perhaps due to the overcast weather, the people present seemed to be quite engaged and interested. The tracking worked well due to stable light conditions, and the whole process went through quite smoothly.

Highlights from conversations with participants and/or folks who stopped to chat: Similar to previous days, older participants were often puzzled by why these videos were so popular, and why younger children liked watching them so much. However, one of our adult participants also remarked that she too watched the videos of the Kinder Eggs occasionally.
