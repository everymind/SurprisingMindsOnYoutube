{% include toc title="Scientific Goals" %}

The Surprising Minds project is part of an effort to develop meaningful methods of science communication beyond publishing academic papers. Here we explore the aquarium as an informal learning setting, where we can engage the visiting public in constructing their own knowledge about neuroscience.

## Crowd Science

## More Behavior Data for Neuroscience

## Mentoring Aspiring Neuroscientists
