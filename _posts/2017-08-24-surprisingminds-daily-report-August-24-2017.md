Brief description of the day: It was a very slow and quiet day. Everyone seemed tired or sick or lethargic -- it was quite difficult to engage people in conversations, and for the first time I saw many young people show extreme trepidation to try out the exhibit. 

The exhibit itself got an update -- the video loop playing on the small monitor to the right of the bubble glass now includes a summary of my Cuttle Shuttle experiment and advertises the [EveryMind Online](http://www.everymind.online) website. You can see the video for yourself here:
