On July 3, 2017, Goncalo, Dario, and I spent the day fitting the interactive station with all of its bits and pieces. We needed to install the monitor (which displays the visual content), the faceplate (which includes the cameras for taking up-close videos of participants eyes), one feedback monitor, and the Intel NUC (a mini-computer) which would play video content to the monitor and store the video recordings from the eye cameras. 

Many other friends and colleagues came to give their support throughout the day. Below is a time-lapse video of our final day before installation!
