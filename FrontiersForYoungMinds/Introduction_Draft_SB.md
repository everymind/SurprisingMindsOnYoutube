# Introduction
Science, for most of its history, has been confined to the pristine and controlled walls of a laboratory, and has effectively been hidden away from the general public. Whilst this approach may have worked well in the past, it is not the best approach for the future. In the middle of a digital age, science now has the tools to allow it to be accessed by a global population, and terms such as ‘citizen science’ and ‘open science’ are now at the heart of a new approach to science, one which includes the citizen in the process of creating knowledge, but also making knowledge available to all. Likewise, in the relatively new field of neuroscience, research cannot be restricted to a laboratory, so the research and the field must open up to the public. Moving foward,to completely unpack and understand the natural workings of the complex human brain, it must be observed in its original environment where it evolved over thousands of years, inside a living body, situated in a busy and demanding world. Studying the inner brain, without the use of invasive methods, remains one of the greatest hurdles in neuroscience. However the human brain depends on many different organs, one of which are the eyes, providing a window for the brain to examine the world around it. Therefore, by observing the reactions and movements of the eyes, one can almost observe the inner workings of the brain.

_‘Surprising Minds on YouTube’_ aims to study the unique responses of a range of human eyes to similar videos. Looking at individual reactions can provide clues about what a person is drawn to, helping uncover some of their brain activity and further, showing patterns within a particular part of a population. Additionally, using non-invasive and mobile equipment, in public spaces, not only opens up a much larger and more diverse sample of the human species for study, but also helps connect more people of all ages and backgrounds to neuroscience, thus, forming a small step in opening up the research, once limited to a laboratory.
