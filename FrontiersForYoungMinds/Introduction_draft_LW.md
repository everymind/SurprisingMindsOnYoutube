Youtube, which has been entertaining millions of people for over 10 years, is the world’s most popular video streaming site. Many find themselves, having logged on which the intention of watching a particular video, spending hours on end watching hundreds of absorbing, but often irrelevant, videos. But what is it that makes these videos so compelling? What is it about the clips which captures the attention of viewers’ brains and draws them into a vicious cycle of endless scrolls and clicks? Whilst it’s primary aim may be to entertain, Youtube has inadvertently built up a huge dataset of information relating to human behaviour and compulsion which has become an invaluable source of information for scientists studying the nature of the human brain.

This report explores how people of different ages respond to watching the same Youtube video, considering the differences between their brains which may be responsible for these reactions. The article will also discusses how public perception about, and engagement with, neuroscience research (which is the study of the brain) varies across different age groups, as well as contexts.
