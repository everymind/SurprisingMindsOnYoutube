## Frontiers of Science - introduction draft #2 <br /> 
For centuries people have questioned the nature of thought or the inner workings of the mind, yet interestingly this subject area began as something strictly reserved for philosophical debate and, with time, soon developed into a more scientific field of study. In more recent years, through vast technological advance and fascinating, new experimental techniques we have developed the ability to study the fundamentals of something we call the nervous system - a circuit of special cells which are highly interconnected with each other, and which govern our thought and perception amongst various other things such as movement. 

This relatively new academic discipline is something we call ‘Neuroscience’ - the study of these structures that comprise our nervous system and how these structures might then work together. Yet despite our progress in such a small space of time, still very little is known about the entire population of this intricate system and the ways in which these components govern complex activities and behaviours. 

Using extremely invasive methods which allow us to peer into the human body and study the brain up close, we can continue to uncover many more secrets about this system. Though sometimes we may need to take a step back and analyse the nervous system from the outside, observing human behaviour as it occurs in everyday life or as it occurs ‘in the wild’. This is what the project, Surprising Minds on Youtube is about: analysing behavioural patterns and human perception without peering through the magnifying glass.
