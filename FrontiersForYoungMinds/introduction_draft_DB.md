## Frontiers of Science - introduction draft #1 <br /> 
For many years we have contemplated the mind and the ‘mechanics’ of cognition and thought - though what started out as something strictly for philosophical debate has now developed into a more experimental or scientific field of study. In more recent years, through vast technological advance and innovative experimental methodology we have developed the ability to study the nervous system from even the cellular level - providing insight into some of the basic structures that comprise our nervous system and, to an extent, how these structures might work together. Due to years of rigorous experimental research we now understand that neurons constitute a major aspect of our nervous system, alongside other cells with somewhat more regulatory function such as glia. Yet despite our vague understanding of how these neurons and accompanying cells might work together, still very little is known about the entire population of this intricate system and the mechanisms of communication that these components use to govern highly complex activities and behaviours. This study of the nervous system can be done in various ways; alongside invasive methods which allow us to peer into the human body and study the brain up close, we can take a step back and analyse the nervous system from the outside, observing human behaviour as it occurs in everyday life or as it occurs ‘in the wild’. Surprising Minds on Youtube provides a more holistic approach to the study of human perception, how this perception differs between various profiles of people and what behavioural patterns can be observed from person to person.
